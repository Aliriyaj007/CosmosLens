## Why This Exists

Most space visualizations fall into two extremes:

* **Textbook diagrams** → accurate, but lifeless
* **Heavy 3D engines / APIs** → impressive, but inaccessible and slow

There was **no tool** that let you:

* Visually *feel* orbital mechanics
* Switch between planetary systems instantly
* Teach concepts without setup, accounts, or installations

**CosmosLens exists to close that gap.**

It is designed to be:

* Instantly usable
* Scientifically grounded (within visual limits)
* Calm, focused, and distraction-free

## What Problem It Solves

| Before                              | After                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Static diagrams or videos           | Fully interactive, explorable systems        |
| Heavy tools (WebGL, Three.js, APIs) | Single-file, vanilla HTML + JS               |
| Hard to explain scale & motion      | Intuitive camera + time controls             |
| No teaching mode                    | Dedicated **Teacher Mode** with orbit trails |
| Solar system only                   | Solar **and** Trappist-1 exoplanet system    |

## Getting Started (Under 60 Seconds)

### Option 1: Use Online (Recommended)

Open the live app:

```
https://aliriyaj007.github.io/CosmosLens/
```

No login. No setup. Works instantly.

---

### Option 2: Run Locally (Offline)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aliriyaj007/CosmosLens.git
cd CosmosLens
```

Open `index.html` in **any modern browser**.

That’s it.

## How to Use

### Navigation

* **Drag** → Rotate view
* **Scroll / Pinch** → Zoom
* **Click planet** → Focus + details

### Controls

* **Time Slider** → Control orbital speed
* **System Selector** → Solar ↔ Trappist-1
* **Teacher Mode** → Orbit trails + clean UI
* **Lab Mode** → Compare size, gravity, and mass

---

## Teaching Use Case

CosmosLens is built to work in:

* Classrooms
* Projectors
* Low-end laptops
* Offline environments

Teacher Mode removes distractions and makes orbital paths visible — ideal for explanations.

## Technical Design (Intentional Choices)

| Decision                 | Reason                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Vanilla JS               | Longevity, zero dependencies  |
| Canvas 2D                | Predictable performance       |
| No backend               | Privacy + offline reliability |
| Single-file architecture | Easy for forks and learning   |
| No frameworks            | Readable, hackable code       |

This project favors **clarity over cleverness**.
